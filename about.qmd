My name is Spencer Paragas. I am an associate analyst at Altria Client Services, as well as a graduate student in the Computer Science Masters of Engineering program at Virginia Tech. This blog is currently set up as the final project in my graduate class on machine learning. My hope, however, is that this blog will eventually turn into something beyond just this class.

Notes on this blog:

Prefers github pages, netlify is allowed but consider switching (he has a how-to on his website)

Add a "view source" link to every page on the website (apparently easily down thru quarto)

#\| warning: false

#\| echo: fenced (shows whole code chunk including the language you're using)

Can put this under execute in quarto.yml so it works for all code chunks

His quarto blog post is considered too much text (should be half), too much scrolling (don't make read time too long, short and snappy)

Submit the website early and he'll try to give his idea on what grade you'll get. For feedback, go to TA office hours
